# Accommodations

Lets cover in no particular order:

**Cheap places to stay (tokyo)**

* Shibuya Granbell Hotel - Prices start at 9,000 Yen a night, average for double is 13,000 Yen. This is possibly the most convenient hotel in Tokyo, 2 blocks from Shibuya Train Station. It's exactly where you want to be, the next closest hotel is the Cerillian Tower which is more like 40,000 Yen a night. Includes breakfast. Several great food options steps away. This hotel is one street off the main drag so it's quieter and nicer, but still super close. Rooms are nice but small, but who goes to Tokyo to hang out in their hotel?


* Hotel Unizo (Shibuya) - Only slightly less convenient than Granbell, Unizo is about 5 minutes walk from the station and more in the heart of Shibuya, directly across the street from Tokyu Hands and Parco department stores. Similar pricing to Granbell but doesn't include breakfast. For a first trip this might be a better option as it feels more like being in the center of it all.
