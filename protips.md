## Where to get money
Typically getting money ahead of time is a huge pain in the ass and it's easier just to pay as you go while traveling. Depending on your credit card (which you should check before going) you might incur additional charges for on the fly currency conversions, and you might need to let your bank know you'll be out of the country. Assuming you know the fees (if any) and your bank knows you are there and won't turn your credit card off assuming fraud the first time you try to use it - most larger places will accept mastercard and visa. That said, Japan is still largely cash based and most of the ATMs require chip/pin cards so they don't work with US cards. However, some ATMs work with international cards and these are the ones you want to look for. These can be found at:
- 7-11
- Japan Post (post office)
- Citibank

While cash is king, Suica is a close second. Suica is the universal debit card that you can use for train rides, vending machines, convenience stores, etc. It's managed by JR Train Lines so you have to buy it at the station. The best bet is to buy it at the JR Ticket station at NRT as soon as you arrive in Japan. You can refill it with cash at JR Train stations as well.
