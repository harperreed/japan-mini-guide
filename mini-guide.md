#Harper's quick mini guide to japan


##Intro:
I decided to write this quick mini guide up while Hiromi and I were brainstorming for things to do in Japan. i figured that if i could translate the things that make traveling to Japan comfortable for me - it may make things a bit easier for the Japan Travel n00bs. I was thinking specifically about food and what happens if you don't like eating squid heads (Hiromi claims that they don't eat squidheads - but we know the truth).

So here goes my quick users guide to Japan. Feel free to add or X out whole sections.


##Food:

###Awesome Food:
There are a lot of awesome places to dine in wonderful japantown. We have quite a few different favorite "haunts" that we have experienced in the last year of traveling to Tokyo and about. Specifically:

- Rondo - Italian/Japanese. Really awesome italian place. - Great proprietors and a hilarious atmosphere
- Fish Market/ Restaurant in Roppongi - Fish. Really nice - fish place. Quite good.
- Christon Cafe - Japanese/Fine Dining - Christianity themed restaurant.
- Noodle shops - Awesome noodle shops everywhere
- Sumo Restaurant - A sumo themed restaurant
- Ninja Restaurant - A ninja themed restaurant
- Macrobiotic restaurant - Great organic food place that hiromi loves and has excellent food.

Obviously there are a lot of excellent places to eat in Tokyo. We can choose any number of nice, yet inexpensive and fun places.

###Easy Food:
As you may have figured out from such experiences as "Sushi" and "Gasho of Japan," Japanese food is mostly raw fish and people with swords (Just kidding, Hiromi is mad because i didn't say that they have a lot of cooked food as well). Because this risk taking can get tiring and possibly even dangerous - I have compiled a small list of possible "safe*" places to find food in case their is a dietary emergency (i.e. Hungry).

"Safe*" food places:

- Mosburger - Awesome mini hamburgers. Easy to eat, good - meat. Like a fancy wendy's
- Convenience stores - a myriad of different edible items. Lots of Rice/Meat combinations. A great place to find a simple sandwich or hotdog.
Family Restaurants (Royal host,Denny's,   - Basically like denny's. You can find pasta, steak, hamburger and japanese food. Pretty random.
- Ramen Restaurants - these are awesome soup places. You order with a vending machine. Usually robots eat here.
- Subway Sandwiches - Pretty much the same as in the US, but with "exotic" toppings like "salmon."

*- Safe purely means easily accessible.

Attractions:

Some places where I think we should go to:

- Asakusa - The big red lanterns. Amazing temple and a great number of shops. Fun area. It is also accessible by boat. It may be cold - but it is a really nice ferry ride.
- Shibuya - this is the big crosswalk
- Tokyo station - an insane mall underground. like a mini underground city.
- Fish market district - crazy fish market district
- Kabukicho - Red light district and nightlife district. Great for finding a fun bar to hang out at.
muji - A really neat japanese ikea like store. They sell premade houses inside
- Parasite museum -  pretty self explanatory
- Kamakura - Big buddha. A half day trip. Totally awesome.
- Tokyu Hands - awesome craft store. MANY MANY Stories
Imperial Palace -
- Akhihabara - Video game and electronic super area.
- Bic Camera - insane multi floor electronics store.
- Bar near hiromi's old house - crazy old ladies waiting for us to drink with them
- Myazaki Museum - the animator that is responsible for toturo, Spirited away, Princess mononoke and others.
Watching an American movie in Tokyo - a hilarious experience. Pretty fun.
- Harajuku - really insane neighborhood. A place to look for crazy people. I like it there. We HAVE to go and stare. Wear your mohawk.
- Roppongi hills - a neat upscale mall/neighborhood

Obviously this is a very limited list. I imagine that there are a lot of places we could visit. We should probably just play it by ear!

##Interesting things:
- Not everywhere takes credit cards. But there are a lot of ATMS around. Specifically postal ATMS. They have the best transfer rate and are open more often than crazy Japanese bank ATMS.
- Bathrooms are almost always clean and easy to find.
- We will attempt to get a mobile phone for us to use.
- There are a lot of little tiny gifts that are perfect for bringing back to friends and super inexpensive.
- Food is easy to find - so if for some reason a restaurant doesn't work out - never fear! We can easily find another quick place nearby.
- The trains end at midnight. So unless we are near our Hotels, we will probably be home around 1am.
- The trains are awesome and easy to understand. There are few places that don't have English - and most of the time it is easy to get around.
- One of the most fun times my father and I had was when we got lost.
- Japanese people are made of plants.
- There are an insane amount of things to see.
- There are vending machines every 3 feet. This is because you will need a new tea every 3 or 4 foot.
