#Food:

Japan has the best food in the world. It is a force to be reckoned with. Do not underestimate how awesome the food can be. 

I don't think there is anyway to make a conversation about japan and food easy. I am going to attempt to at least cover my 3 most asked questions:

1. Can i survive as a vegetarian or vegan?
2. What is the best easy food?
3. Where is the best food?

Also will include a list of some of our favorite places. 

##Surviving as a vegetarian or vegan

(sean please add)

Japan is a bit difficult to navigate without some assitance but this hs gotten incredibly easier in recent years. There are countless vegan and vegetarian options all over the place if you know what to look for and a growing number of vegan exclusive spots.

Best tip: Get the Happy Cow app. The list there is excellent and well maintained which is helpful finding things close to you when out and about. That said, here's some pro tips:

### Easy & Everywhere

* Family Mart
* Any Sushi Place


### Favorite All Vegan Spots

* Nagi Shokudo
* Brown Rice Cafe
* Pure Cafe
* T's Tantan


##Quick list of favorite places:
There are a lot of awesome places to dine in wonderful Tokyo. We have quite a few different favorite "haunts" that we have experienced in the last year of traveling to Tokyo and about. Specifically:

- Rondo - Italian/Japanese. Really awesome italian place. - Great proprietors and a hilarious atmosphere
- Macrobiotic restaurant - Great organic food place that hiromi loves and has excellent food. (need to get the name)
- Draemon - brick oven bar/restaurant in Dogenzaka (near Shibuya) 


###Easy Food:

- Mosburger - Awesome mini hamburgers. Easy to eat, good - meat. Like a fancy wendy's
- Convenience stores - a myriad of different edible items. Lots of Rice/Meat combinations. A great place to find a simple sandwich or hotdog.
Family Restaurants (Royal host,Denny's,   - Basically like denny's. You can find pasta, steak, hamburger and japanese food. Pretty random.
- Ramen Restaurants - these are awesome soup places. You order with a vending machine. Usually robots eat here.
- Subway Sandwiches - Pretty much the same as in the US, but with "exotic" toppings like "salmon."
