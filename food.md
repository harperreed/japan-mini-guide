###Awesome Food:
There are a lot of awesome places to dine in wonderful Tokyo. We have quite a few different favorite "haunts" that we have experienced in the last year of traveling to Tokyo and about. Specifically:

- Rondo - Italian/Japanese. Really awesome italian place. - Great proprietors and a hilarious atmosphere
- Macrobiotic restaurant - Great organic food place that hiromi loves and has excellent food. (need to get the name)

These are terrible recs:
- Fish Market/ Restaurant in Roppongi - Fish. Really nice - fish place. Quite good.
- Christon Cafe - Japanese/Fine Dining - Christianity themed restaurant.
- Noodle shops - Awesome noodle shops everywhere
- Sumo Restaurant - A sumo themed restaurant
- Ninja Restaurant - A ninja themed restaurant


Obviously there are a lot of excellent places to eat in Tokyo. We can choose any number of nice, yet inexpensive and fun places.

###Easy Food:

- Mosburger - Awesome mini hamburgers. Easy to eat, good - meat. Like a fancy wendy's
- Convenience stores - a myriad of different edible items. Lots of Rice/Meat combinations. A great place to find a simple sandwich or hotdog.
Family Restaurants (Royal host,Denny's,   - Basically like denny's. You can find pasta, steak, hamburger and japanese food. Pretty random.
- Ramen Restaurants - these are awesome soup places. You order with a vending machine. Usually robots eat here.
- Subway Sandwiches - Pretty much the same as in the US, but with "exotic" toppings like "salmon."
