#Food:

Japan has the best food in the world. It is a force to be reckoned with. Do not underestimate how awesome the food can be. 

I don't think there is anyway to make a conversation about japan and food easy. I am going to attempt to at least cover my 3 most asked questions:

1. Can i survive as a vegetarian or vegan?
2. What is the best easy food?
3. Where is the best food?

Also will include a list of some of our favorite places. 

##Surviving as a vegetarian or vegan


##Quick list of favorite places:
There are a lot of awesome places to dine in wonderful Tokyo. We have quite a few different favorite "haunts" that we have experienced in the last year of traveling to Tokyo and about. Specifically:

- Rondo - Italian/Japanese. Really awesome italian place. - Great proprietors and a hilarious atmosphere
- Macrobiotic restaurant - Great organic food place that hiromi loves and has excellent food. (need to get the name)


###Easy Food:

- Mosburger - Awesome mini hamburgers. Easy to eat, good - meat. Like a fancy wendy's
- Convenience stores - a myriad of different edible items. Lots of Rice/Meat combinations. A great place to find a simple sandwich or hotdog.
Family Restaurants (Royal host,Denny's,   - Basically like denny's. You can find pasta, steak, hamburger and japanese food. Pretty random.
- Ramen Restaurants - these are awesome soup places. You order with a vending machine. Usually robots eat here.
- Subway Sandwiches - Pretty much the same as in the US, but with "exotic" toppings like "salmon."
