In 2006 when i started going to japan regularly, I couldn't find any quick and easy resources to help me understand how to handle japan. There were a lot of travel books, but nothing that really helped me figure out wtf japan was going to be like and how i could hack my japanese travel. 

I wanted to know things like:

- Where is the best metal bar? 
- Where can i get the best ramen?
- Why are the 7/11s so awesome?
- What are gatcha gacha balls
- Do i need to know japanese?
- Does anyone speak english? 
- What do i do about my giant tattoo?

I could do a LOT of research and find SOME answers, but there was nothing that was "A hackers guide to Japan." 

Around 2007, my parents, brother and his partner decided to come to Japan and visit with Hiromi and myself. As a way to get them up to speed, I decided to whip up the first version of this terrible book. 

It was mostly a list of things that I had found hilarious. It was probably terrible and not helpful - but it was based on all my random experiences. 

I keep sending the original book to various friends and I regret it every time. I keep thinking "I should really rewrite that terrible guide." So, here we go...
