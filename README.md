Hackers Guide To Japan
====

##Where to start

This guide is a collection of lists. We felt that this was the best way to display information about Japan. 

The best place to dive in is the [Pro-tips](protips.md) section. 


##Background

This started as a very simple "guide" to Japan based on the experiences of @seanbonner and myself. We were always being asked various Japanese travel queries by friends. We wanted to make a simple "Hackers Guide To Japan."

Since this is such a HUGE topic - it became unwieldy. 

However, in asking people for help, we noticed that everyone has a list. 

So, the "Hackers guide to Japan" has turned into a collection of lists that are contributed by ourselves and our friends. 

In some cases they are community generated and others they are aggressively proscriptive. 

Obviously YMMV.
